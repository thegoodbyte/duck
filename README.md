## About the 'A Random Living Duck' project

Developed as a part of the coding exercise.
- No DB necessary
- Please set up your Apache host and go to the '/duck' URL
- Refresh the page - you will see a different instance of the Living breathing Duck
- ... every time you refresh
- You will also see a changing Image of the Duck

##A thought about the Design
I was not sure at first how to appreacoh it... (a few more designs came to my mind...
But I then decided for a random Duck instantiation ...
### Design patterns 
I dont really have any design pattern there - was thinking about Singleton (Would not give me the randomization unless I would be changing properties of the 
Singleton instance), then I was thinking about a Factory Design and a Listener design pattern etc.. (there are multiple scenarios possible, but if I understand it correctly - this is not about the design patterns but a creativity..
...and  this is sweet and simple :-))
## GIT commits

I apologize but I started working on it without the GIT and I was already finished when I realized that you need to see the commits ...
